The biological motivation and scientific rationale behind this project was to test the hypothesis that matrix metalloproteases can be therapeutically modulated to impact cardiovascular/renal/metabolic disease outcomes.  
Used GTex, NIH All of Us Research Program large-scale data cohorts.
Interested in computationally investigating the "MMPx" landscape (e.g., MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, MMP13, etc.) at data-driven scale and publishing our findings, which will likely impact research & development in the broader drug discovery space over the next few years.
